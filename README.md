Q1:
  When _clone_ is used, it sets the origin to represent the branch cloned is called on, including the whole history.
Q2:
  _git push --set -upstream origin master_ sets the current local branch to the remote branch. Remote tracking is tracking the changes between the local copy and the remote branch.
Q3:
  _git pull origin master_ will pull the branch from the remote main and merge it to the local branch. This takes all staged changes locally and combines them with the remote origin, then combines them into one local branch.
Q4:
  _git pull origin master_ acted as a merge, combining both local and remote branches and keeping both of their changes, which doesn't overwrite the local changes.
Q5:
  The standard use of _git pull origin master_ is a merge, but it can be changed to rebase using flags.
Q6:
  Still behind the remote master
Q7:
  The branch did not delete locally on person B's repo. Removed it with _git branch -d branchy_
Q8:
